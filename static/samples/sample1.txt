Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my concern about the increasing problem of plastic pollution in our oceans. Every day, thousands of marine animals are killed by plastic waste that humans carelessly throw away.

First of all, plastic bags and bottles are not biodegradable. This means that once they enter the ocean, they stay there for hundreds of years, breaking down into smaller pieces called microplastics that are eaten by fish and other sea creatures.

Secondly, many animals mistake plastic items for food. For example, sea turtles often eat plastic bags thinking they are jellyfish. This can cause them to choke or starve because their stomachs are full of plastic instead of real food.

To solve this problem, I think we should take several actions. The government should ban single-use plastics like straws and bags. People should use reusable shopping bags and water bottles. Schools should teach students about the importance of recycling.

I hope that by raising awareness about this issue, we can all work together to reduce plastic pollution and protect our oceans for future generations.

Yours sincerely,
Student
